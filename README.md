<h1> Cryptography and Steganography using Matrices </h1>
<h2> Description <h2>
In this project, we are exploring the field of cryptography and steganography with the help of matrices and implementing these processes by creating new algorithms and using some inbuilt python functionalities. We are not trying to achieve the benchmarks of the python libraries that have the functionalities but trying and implement them in a different way that gets the job done.
<h2> Encryption and Cryptography <h2>
We will try to encrypt a message into a cypher matrix. For this, first, we will get the ASCII values of the message and then arrange them into a matrix. Then we will transform this matrix using linear transformations and send that as the encrypted message. The receiver must provide the transformation function as a key to interpret the encrypted message.
<h2> Concepts used <h2>
Linear transformation, matrix multiplication. Inverse of a matrix.
